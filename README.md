# Fraud_Detection

Fraud detection is a critical challenge in financial transactions, where fraudulent activities often constitute a tiny fraction of total transactions. This Fraud Detection Model is built using Machine Learning techniques to accurately identify fraudulent transactions while minimizing false positives.

This project leverages Random Forest to handle class imbalance and improve fraud detection accuracy. The model is evaluated using Precision-Recall, F1-score, and AUC-ROC, ensuring robust performance on real-world datasets.

Key Takeaways
✅ AUC-ROC = 91.42%, meaning the model is excellent at distinguishing fraud from legitimate transactions.
✅ Precision & Recall Trade-off: The model correctly detects 67% of fraud cases, but 33% are missed.
